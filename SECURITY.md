# NeuraFix GitHub Security Policy

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this security policy is to ensure the security and integrity of the **NeuraFix** GitHub repository, its code, contributors, and associated infrastructure. The policy defines how access is managed, sensitive data is handled, and how contributors should secure their contributions to the project.

## 2. Authentication and Access Control
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: All users with access to the repository must enable MFA to ensure an added layer of security.
- **Access Levels**:
  - **Public Repositories**: If the repository is public, contributors can fork and submit pull requests.
  - **Private Repositories**: Access to private repositories is restricted. Permissions are assigned based on roles (Admin, Write, Read).
- **Least Privilege**: Access is granted based on the principle of least privilege. Users will be given the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Use GitHub Teams and Organizations to manage access based on roles. Admin rights should be limited to trusted users.
  
## 3. Sensitive Information Handling
- **No Secrets in Code**: Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, private keys) into the codebase. Use environment variables or encrypted vaults.
- **`.gitignore` and `.env` Files**: Ensure all sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, configuration files) are listed in `.gitignore` to avoid accidental commits.
- **Secrets Scanning**: Use GitHub’s secret scanning to detect accidental commits of sensitive information, such as API keys or credentials.

## 4. Code Contributions
- **Fork and Pull Request Workflow**: All code contributions must go through the fork and pull request process. Direct commits to the `main` or `develop` branch are prohibited.
- **Code Review**: At least one other trusted contributor must review and approve all pull requests before merging. Special attention should be given to security-related changes.
- **Branch Protection**: The `main` and `develop` branches are protected. These branches will require successful checks (e.g., tests, linters) before merging, and force-pushes are not allowed.
- **Automated Security Scans**: Use GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in all pull requests and commits.

## 5. Dependency Management
- **Dependabot**: Enable Dependabot for automatic detection of outdated dependencies and vulnerabilities. Regularly update dependencies to minimize security risks.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly run dependency scanning tools (e.g., GitHub's security advisories, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in the repository’s dependencies.
- **Minimal Dependency Usage**: Only include dependencies that are necessary for the project. Ensure that third-party packages are from trusted sources.

## 6. Incident Response and Reporting
- **Incident Handling**: In case of a security vulnerability or breach, the repository maintainers will follow a defined incident response procedure, including containment, analysis, and mitigation.
- **Security Advisories**: Security vulnerabilities identified in the project will be reported via GitHub security advisories. If necessary, a fix will be provided, and a CVE will be assigned.
- **Reporting Vulnerabilities**: If you discover a security vulnerability, report it via GitHub Issues (using the security label) or email it directly to **security@neurafix.com**.

## 7. Automated Testing and Continuous Integration
- **CI/CD Integration**: Use GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools to automatically run tests, security scans, and linting on every pull request.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Integrate static analysis tools in the CI pipeline to check for common vulnerabilities and insecure coding practices.
- **Dynamic Security Testing**: Run dynamic security tests to detect runtime vulnerabilities during the development lifecycle.

## 8. Code of Conduct and Best Practices
- **Contributor Code of Conduct**: All contributors must follow the project's Code of Conduct, which includes ethical guidelines for contributing, reporting vulnerabilities, and maintaining security practices.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding best practices, including input validation, using HTTPS for network communication, and avoiding common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.

## 9. Monitoring and Logging
- **Audit Logging**: Enable GitHub’s audit log (available for GitHub Enterprise) to monitor and track repository activities, including changes to permissions and critical code changes.
- **Suspicious Activity Monitoring**: Set up automated alerts for suspicious activities like unauthorized access attempts or abnormal commit patterns.

## 10. Compliance and Legal Considerations
- **Licensing**: The repository will comply with all applicable licensing requirements. A `LICENSE` file should be present and accurately reflect the terms under which the code is shared.
- **Privacy Regulations**: If the repository processes personal data, ensure compliance with relevant data privacy laws such as GDPR, CCPA, etc.
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Review and comply with the licensing and security requirements for all third-party dependencies.

## 11. Review and Updates
- **Policy Review**: The security policy will be reviewed at least annually and updated as needed to address new security threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Security Audits**: Periodic security audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the security measures in place and identify potential improvements.
